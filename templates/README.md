by amasiye313@gmail.com

## Description

Sendama is a 2D game engine for creating terminal based games. It is designed to be simple and easy to use, while
providing the necessary tools to create fun and engaging games. The engine is built using PHP and is designed to be
cross-platform, so you can create games that run on Windows, Linux, and macOS. Rather than using complex graphics
libraries, Sendama uses simple ASCII characters to create game worlds, making it easy to create games that are both
fun and visually appealing. By leveraging the power of ANSI escape codes, Sendama allows you to create games that are
interactive and engaging, with support for keyboard input, animations, and more.

## Running the Game

To run the game, simply run the following command:
```bash
sendama play
```
